An intelligent system that enhances RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities for code repositories through an agent-based architecture.

## üéØ Overview

This project addresses the challenges of applying RAG to code repositories in technical support scenarios. Instead of relying on traditional RAG approaches, we implement an agent-based architecture that intelligently processes and refines context to generate more accurate and meaningful responses.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Traditional RAG systems face limitations when dealing with code repositories:
- Code chunks often lack necessary context for effective indexing
- Direct code snippets may not provide sufficient context for LLM response synthesis
- Standard RAG approaches struggle with technical documentation spread across multiple repositories

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The solution implements a multi-step agent architecture:

1. **üìù Scratchpad System**
   - Maintains question-specific context information
   - Starts with initial retrieval chunks from RAG vector store
   - Iteratively refines context through agent interactions

2. **üîç Evaluator Component**
   - Assesses if current context is sufficient for answering queries
   - Determines need for additional context refinement
   - Triggers appropriate refinement tools when needed

3. **üß† Context Refinement Agent**
   Employs various tools including:
   - Repo relevance scoring and filtering
   - File and directory summarization
   - Complete code file inclusion when necessary
   - Irrelevant chunk removal
   - Documentation linking and integration
   - External resource integration

4. **‚ö° Tool Selector**
   - Intelligently chooses appropriate refinement tools
   - Can operate based on:
     - Predetermined sequences
     - Rule-based policies
     - Dynamic decision-making

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Smart context preparation for RAG
- Dynamic context refinement
- Intelligent tool selection
- Integration with multiple knowledge sources
- Support for technical documentation and code repositories

## üí™ Benefits

- Enhanced context understanding
- More accurate responses to technical queries
- Better handling of code-related questions
- Improved technical support efficiency
- Flexible and extensible architecture

## üéØ Example Use Case

The example below demonstrates how the agentic RAG improves response quality compared to baseline RAG:
This example is from an Infineon community forum post. Infineon has over 1000 code repositories.

### Question Context
A user inquires about microcontroller sleep states and wake signals.

### Process Flow

1. **Initial RAG Response** (Score: 0.3)
   - Basic chunks retrieved
   - Limited context about sleep states
   - Insufficient information for a complete answer

2. **Context Refinement Applied**
   - Evaluator determines initial context is insufficient
   - Tool Selector identifies relevant file
   - Complete file context added to scratchpad

3. **Improved Response** (Score: 0.7)
   - Comprehensive information about:
     - HOST_WAKE signals
     - DEV_WAKE functionality
     - Sleep state management
     - Related wake mechanisms
